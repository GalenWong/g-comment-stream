# g-comment-stream
g(alen)-comment-stream is a react/node web app for workshop audience/speaker interaction.

# How to run
```
npm start
```

# What is this application?
It allows user to submit a message on `/messages` endpoint. The message will show up on `/` real time with socket. 

# Why I created this application
I created this application for a demo in an introduction to backend development workshop that I taught.

It is a intuitive and interactive way to students to see the browser making a POST request 
with the network tab under Chrome DevTools.

It is also a learning experience for me to write an application that uses socket instead of HTTP requests.
I learned how to implement socket and how to deploy and web application with Azure with this project.
I was very enjoyable.
